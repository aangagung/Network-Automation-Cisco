#This code will share to you how to connect ssh use phyton to cisco devices
#Make sure you have to update phyton to new version 

#First install service netmiko 

#Second Call service netmiko with directory ConnectHandler (note: ConnectHandler is directory service for conneting ssh )
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

#Third create information about cisco device with attached the credential
SW01 = 	{
	   'device_type':'cisco_ios',
	   'host':'192.168.1.1',
	   'username':'admin',
	   'password':'cisco',
     	   'secret':'cisco123',
	}

#Fourth create session id for conneting ssh to cisco devices (note: anyway you can create the id with any word or char, but in this session i will call the session id with name SSH_CON)
SSH_CON = ConnectHandler(**SW01)

#Fiveth check the connection (note: if the session is success, phyton will pop up massage like this <netmiko.cisco.cisco_ios.CiscoIosSSH object at 0x03516580> )  
SSH_CON 

#Sixth try to open privillage 15 with enable (note: if enable is success, phyton will pop up massage like this 'enable\r\nPassword: \r\nR1#')
SSH_CON.enable()

#Seventh try to push command show privilage (note: if push command is success, phyton will show the credential like this 'Current privilege level is 15')
SSH_CON.send_command("show privilege")

#The last, just remember after you connet ssh from phyton you must logout to
SSH_CON.disconnect()

#Congratulation you're now success connect to your cisco devices, and now you can practice with other show command for testing
#thanks all, i will share another code what i used for my daily report as network engineer
